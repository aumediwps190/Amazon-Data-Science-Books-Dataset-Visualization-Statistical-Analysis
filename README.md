This repository contains a project created as an assignment to Hacktiv8 FTDS course.

The project is a data-based business analysis. SMART method is used for the business understanding. The case is establishing a *dropshipping scheme* to ease local access to data-science books. 

The dataset is obtained from kaggle (original link in the .ipynb). After some cleaning, an exploratory data analysis is conducted on the data. The result are five graphs as well as their insight written in the notebook.

This EDA is then published into a dashboard using Tableau for interactive use (link is also in the .ipynb).
